# DoggoDec18
## About Project
Reiteration of practice project [DoggoDec17](https://github.com/mittons/doggoDec17), for consolidation/refining of my skillset.

Uses/will use an image of the [MockDogApiDec18 project](https://github.com/mittons/MockDogApiDec18) for integration testing. Hooray for that!

## Reflections
Again, as i mentioned in the I [DoggoDec17 README](https://github.com/mittons/doggoDec17), I need to create a seperate account for practice projects like this, once that iterate mostly on what I already know and add only small amount of skill on top of that.
